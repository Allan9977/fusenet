# FuseNet
FuseNet is developed as a general architecture for deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for the purpose of training dataset with RGB-D images. It can be used for semantic segmentation, scene classification and many other applications. This repository is an official release of the original work, and it is implemented based on the [BVLC/caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) framework.
